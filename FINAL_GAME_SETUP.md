## 🐛 Troubleshooting:

### **Power-ups still don't work?**
→ Check player has Rigidbody2D with `Is Trigger` unchecked
→ Verify PowerUp GameObjects have "PowerUp" tag

### **Radar not showing?**
→ The WorkingRadar component auto-creates on Play
→ Check for "✅ Created working radar system" in console

### **Maze still small?**
→ Check MazeGenerator component
→ Should say mazeWidth=60, mazeHeight=60

### **Player still looks square?**
→ ComprehensiveGameFix creates new sprite
→ Check for "✅ Player graphics enhanced" in console

## 📈 Performance:

Despite the bigger maze:
- ✅ Optimized maze generation
- ✅ Radar updates efficiently (5 FPS)
- ✅ Organic variation only affects 30% of walls
