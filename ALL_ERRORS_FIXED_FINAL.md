# ✅ ALL COMPILATION ERRORS FIXED - FINAL!

## 🎯 Last Error Fixed:

### **Error: UIManager Reference**
```
Assets\Scripts\GameIntegration.cs(337,12): error CS0246: 
The type or namespace name 'UIManager' could not be found
```

**Cause:** 
- `GameIntegration.cs` was referencing `UIManager`
- We deleted `UIManager.cs` (old, replaced by `RealisticUISystem`)

**Fix:**
- Replaced all `UIManager` references with `RealisticUISystem`
- Updated field: `public RealisticUISystem realisticUI;`
- Updated getter: `public RealisticUISystem GetRealisticUI()`
- Updated initialization logic
