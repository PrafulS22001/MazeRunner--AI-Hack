## 🤖 **AI IMPROVEMENTS:**

### New Smart Features:

```
When player leaves glade:
- 🚨 "ALERT: Player entered the maze!"

- 🏃 Starts chasing if close enough
- 🧠 All spiders become more aggressive
```

#### **2. Advanced Pathfinding:**
```
- 🎯 Tests 8 different directions
- 📊 Scores each path by:
  * Distance to walls
  * Alignment with player direction
  * Path clearance
- ✅ Chooses best route to player
- 🧭 Navigates maze intelligently
```

#### **3. Glade Awareness:**
```
Player in Glade:
- 😴 Normal detection (5 units)
- 🚶 Standard behavior

Player in Maze:
- 🚨 Enhanced detection (8 → 12 units)
- 🏃 More aggressive
- 🧠 Smarter tracking
```

## 🎮 **HOW IT WORKS:**

### Fog System:

1. **Glade Area:**
   - Center: (0, 0)
   - Radius: Calculated from gladeSize
   - **Status: FOG-FREE ✓**

2. **Maze Area:**
   - Everything outside glade
   - **Status: FOGGY ☁️**

3. **As You Play:**
   - Start in clear glade
   - Enter maze → fog covers everything
   - Move around → fog reveals
   - Return to glade → still clear!

### AI Behavior:

#### **Phase 1: Player in Glade** (Safe)
```
Spiders:
- 😴 Patrol routes
- 👁️ Normal detection (5 units)
- 🎨 Dark red color
```

#### **Phase 2: Player Enters Maze** (Alert!)
```
Spiders:
- 🚨 "Player entered maze!"
- 👁️ Detection increased (8 units)
- 🏃 Chase if close
- 🎨 Bright red when chasing
```

#### **Phase 3: Chasing** (Danger!)
```
Spiders:
- 🎯 Smart pathfinding active
- 🧭 Tests 8 directions
- 📊 Chooses best route
- 🏃 Fast movement (1.5x speed)
- 🎨 Pure red color
```

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL DETAILS:**

### Fog Glade Exclusion:
```csharp
// Calculate if position is in glade
float distToGlade = Vector2.Distance(position, gladeCenter);
if (distToGlade > gladeRadius)
{
    // Outside glade - create fog
    CreateFogCloud(position);
}
// Inside glade - skip
```

### AI Maze Detection:
```csharp
// Check player distance from center
float distFromCenter = Vector2.Distance(player.position, Vector2.zero);
if (distFromCenter > gladeRadius)
{
    playerInMaze = true;
    detectionRange = 8f; // Increase
}
```

### Smart Pathfinding:
```csharp
// Test 8 directions (every 45°)
// Score based on:
// - Clear distance
// - Player direction alignment
// - Wall avoidance
// Choose best scoring direction
```
