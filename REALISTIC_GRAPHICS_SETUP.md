### **"Graphics look weird!"**
Solution:
1. Select `RealisticGraphicsSystem` in Hierarchy
2. Right-click component → "Enhance All Graphics"
3. Or restart the game (Exit Play mode, Press Play again)

### **"I see the old square fog!"**
Solution:
1. Press **F12** to run the complete fixer

The new ClashStyleFogSystem should be much more visible now with:
