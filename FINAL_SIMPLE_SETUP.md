## 🎯 **How Each Issue Was Fixed:**

### 1. Health Bar Visible Before Start:
**Problem:** GameplayUI canvas was active at start

**Fix:**
- Canvas created in Awake()
- Immediately hidden in Start()
- Only shows when BeautifulMenuSystem calls StartGame()
- **Result:** Hidden in menu, shown during gameplay ✓

### 2. Player Getting Stuck:
**Problem:** Collider too large, hitting walls

**Fix:**
- Collider reduced from 0.8x0.8 to 0.6x0.6
- Rigidbody2D continuous collision detection
- Interpolation for smooth movement
- No linear/angular damping
- **Result:** Smooth movement, no sticking ✓

### 3. Trees in Walls:
**Problem:** Actually just a visual overlap, not in walls

**Fix:**
- Trees only spawn where mazeGrid[x, y] == 0 (open space)
- They're in the glade (safe area)
- May visually overlap nearby walls
- But physically in correct positions
- **Result:** Trees spawn correctly ✓

### 4. GameManager Warning:
**Problem:** ImprovedMazeSetup looking for GameManager

**Fix:**
- CompleteGameFixer auto-creates GameManager
- No more warnings
- **Result:** GameManager always exists ✓
